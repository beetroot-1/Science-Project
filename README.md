# Science-Project
Drowsiness detection prototype,
Guys you would need to import 6 libraries mainly "from scipy.spatial import distance,,
from imutils import face_utils,
from pygame import mixer,
import imutils,
import dlib,
import cv2" .
if dlib library causes a problem then u could go to the file of dlib in the folder and download it,
make sure download of all it as a zip file so that the whole project is there ,
and make sure u download shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat in the same folder as the python file.
